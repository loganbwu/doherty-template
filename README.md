# doherty-template

This repository contains unofficial Doherty templates for R Shiny and RMarkdown. The styling has been made as consistent as possible with the Doherty website.

## Usage

Clone the repository, copy the `R/` folder for R Shiny or `Rmd/` for RMarkdown into your own project and edit the files with your own content.

## Contribute

If creating a new template, consider restructuring the folders. Ensure there is one folder per template so the user can copy an entire folder. If you make changes to one `.css` file, consider making it in the others.
